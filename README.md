# RecommendationSystem
 The purpose of this project was to build a recommendation system for customers of a food producer. To accomplish this task, the transaction records of all customers were analyzed for patterns of correlation regarding which different items were often bought by the same individuals. A rating system was established based on these records, and the 5 most similar unbought items to each customer's highest-rated purchases were recommended to that customer. The next step would be to modularize the data input and analysis methods so that new transaction data could be easily fed into the system to generate more updated recommendations and so that new users could be added and recommended a baseline set of items until their transaction history is more substantial. Another avenue of development would be to create a timeseries-based model that measures the effectiveness of the recommendation system, tracking whether users are buying the recommended items after receiving the recommendations or whether they are buying similar or dissimilar items, and then using this information to develop potential optimizations for the system.
